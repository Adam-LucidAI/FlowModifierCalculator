# FlowModifierCalculator

This tool designs graduated-hole or vane flow modifiers and now includes a JavaFX desktop studio.

## Build & Run

```
mvn test
mvn javafx:run
```

The project still references the [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) repository, but
STL export is temporarily disabled while the library selection is finalised.

The CLI version can still be run using the exec plugin profile.

Screenshots are available in `screenshots/gui.png`.
